<p>This Japanese animated film checks all the right boxes: excellent fantasy love story, really cool animation (renderings) and great soundtrack.</p>
<p>Film Synopsis: Two teenagers share a profound, magical connection upon discovering they are swapping bodies. Things manage to become even more complicated when the boy and girl decide to meet in person.</p>
<h3>#2: WALL-E</h3>

<p>How should I put this? I could not remember how many times I watched this 3D animated movie! I love how a simple and cute robot, together with humans and other robots, in a dystopian future were able to help revive the Earth.</p>
<p>Film Synopsis: WALL-E, short for Waste Allocation Load Lifter Earth-class, is the last robot left on Earth. He spends his days tidying up the planet, one piece of garbage at a time. But during 700 years, WALL-E has developed a personality, and he's more than a little lonely. Then he spots EVE, a sleek and shapely probe sent back to Earth on a scanning mission. Smitten WALL-E embarks on his greatest adventure yet when he follows EVE across the galaxy.</p>
<h3>#1: Inception</h3>

<p>This for me is Christopher Nolan's best work and, by far, the most epic movie in terms of storyline, cinematography and CGI. This showcases how a movie should look and feel like.</p>
<p>Dom Cobb (Leonardo DiCaprio) is a thief with the rare ability to enter people's dreams and steal their secrets from their subconscious. His skill has made him a hot commodity in the world of corporate espionage but has also cost him everything he loves. Cobb gets a chance at redemption when he is offered a seemingly impossible task: Plant an idea in someone's mind. If he succeeds, it will be the perfect crime, but a dangerous enemy anticipates Cobb's every move.</p>
